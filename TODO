IDEA :
Maybe drawCardWithValue could be getCardWithValue, and only draw it when necessary (with a boolean flag ?)


CURRENT :
- Forum phase. See /docs for details on bidding
- Files : action_forum.twig

BUG :
- Prevent player from entering the same party name in ViewGame
-Mortality phase :
Dead senators' Province got to Forum, Concessions go to curia

Revenue :
- Senator taking spoil MAY decide to pay negative values or let Rome do so.
- All provinces revenue should happen after all senators revenue, because the province might have bedome developed this turn, which changes the income.
- Rebel legions maintenance.
